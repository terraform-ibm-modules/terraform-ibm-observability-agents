The agent for IBM Cloud Logs is starting up on each node in your cluster.
Logs will start to appear in your instance in a minute.

To verify the agents are started, run:
  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get ds {{ .Release.Name }}

Some changes to the configuration may require the pods to be restarted:
  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} rollout restart ds/{{ .Release.Name }}
